[Verse]
           D          C
16|You made a man out of me
              Am        
But you're not satisfied
         D                C
You make believe what you see
       Am
But never leave an eye
      D       C
Got a million things 
      Am
On my mind cause you..
C       D               Am
I don't know what we'll do

33|I only wanted to love you
         D        C          Am
You only wanted a taste
   D           C             Am
My ambition to woo you
            C            D
Was all the time that we wa...

[Verse]
          D           C
1:15|And every time that I think 
        Am
About the better days
         D            C
Remember how we would kiss
           Am
When we were high on haze
D        C
We never knew 
          Am               C
'bout the way things work
        D           Am
I still need to forget


               D         C          Am
1:32|Cause when you wanted protection
            D           C           Am
You used to call out my name
             D          C           Am
And all this changing direction
             C           D
Ain't making me feel the same...
Am                     C      Am
Me feel the same about you


[Chorus]
              D      Am           C     Am
111|Why don't you set me free? yeah

Why don't you set me free?

Why don't you set me free? yeah
              D      Am   
Why don't you set me free?

C              Am    D      Am 
All you got to do is set me free
C              Am    D      Am
